Swing, is a closed-loop traffic generator, aimed
for laboratory experiments. The current beta release
possibly contains a number of bugs that have not
manifested in the limited testing the authors have
done before releasing the source code.
We would love to hear about any such findings. Any
ideas for improvements are of course, always welcome.

Please read all the categories, INSTALL, USAGE, ASSUMPTIONS,
and DESCRIPTION before prooceeding with experimentation.


The brief explanation here assumes BASH as the shell
environment. Please alter the commands as appropriate
per your environment.


ASSUMPTIONS:
============
* You have sudo access on all machines.
* A sample hosts.xml is provided, please modify as appropriate.
* Make sure tcpdump is in your path.
* Make sure modelnet is up and running in the cluser, and that 
  modelnet's bindir is in your path.
* /usr/local/bin/bash and /usr/bin/bash both exist.
* All machines used in the cluster can mount the same NFS dirs.
* gexec/gexecd/authd are all present in /usr/local/sbin
* Each trace that acts as input to Swing is self-contained
  in a dir.
* Each expt produces a trace that is, again, self-contained
  in a dir, which in-turn is a subdir of ${SWINGTRACES}.


INSTALL:
========
$ ./configure --prefix=<directory where you want Swing installed>
$ make
$ make install


USAGE:
======
$ export SWINGHOME=<dir of Swing installation> 
(i.e. same as that used in prefix above)

$ export PATH=${SWINGHOME}:${PATH}

now here are two different usage scenarios

Scenario1:
----------
	Say you have a single file (in pcap format).
	Rename it as fileboth.dump

    create a directory for storing the trace, say tracedir1
	$ mkdir /home/john/tracedir1
	$ cp tracefile.dump /home/john/tracedir1/

	say the outputs are in some dir ${SWINGTRACES}
	and this particular expt is in dir swingexpt1
	now call
	$ swing_masterscript.sh /home/john/tracedir1 <filehandle> ${SWINGHOME} swingexpt1 ${SWINGTRACES}

	After the expt the trace will be collected in dir ${SWINGTRACES}/swingexpt1
	as fileboth, file0 and file1

Scenario2:
----------
	Say you have two files (file0 and file1), corresponding
	to the two directions of traffic

    create a directory for storing the trace, say tracedir1
	$ mkdir /home/john/tracedir1
	$ cp file0 file1 /home/john/tracedir1/

	say the outputs are in some dir ${SWINGTRACES}
	and this particular expt is in dir swingexpt1
	now call
	$ swing_masterscript.sh /home/john/tracedir1 <filehandle> ${SWINGHOME} swingexpt1 ${SWINGTRACES}

	After the expt the trace will be collected in dir ${SWINGTRACES}/swingexpt1
	as fileboth, file0 and file1

Note, that both scenarios are almost identical.



DESCRIPTION:
============
swing_masterscript.sh involves 3 stages

Stage 0: Convert 2way trace (say fileboth.dump) to 1way traces (file0 and file1) if
neeeded. 
(scripts/swing_trace_convert_2way_2_1way.sh)

Stage 1: Extract user/network/application parameters from  the trace
(scripts/swing_extractuserappnwparams.sh)

Stage 2: Configure the expt with metadata etc.
Run the xpt.
Collect the resulting swing trace.
(scripts/swing_exptpreprocess.sh)

These stages can be called independently too.
Please modify as appropriate.
